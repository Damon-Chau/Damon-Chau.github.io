            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>My name is Damon Chau and I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of
            Waterloo. </p>

            <p>I was born in Toronto and currently reside in the City of Maple. I attended St. Robert
            Catholic High School where I was an honour roll student for all 4 years of high school.
            In my grade 12 year, I started taking Computer Science Class. The teacher that taught this
            course inspired me to pursue a STEM related field. He taught me the fundamentals of programming
            and the software development life cycle and continuously pushed me to learn outside of class.</p>
